# Crypto Price Tracker

Simple starter project that fetches cryptocurrency prices using CoinGecko API.

## How it works
- `main.py` contains a `get_price(coin_id)` function that returns the USD price.
- Example usage prints Bitcoin price.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- requests library

## How to run (optional)
1. Install Python (if not installed).
2. Install requests: `pip install requests`
3. Run: `python main.py`

## Notes
This is a beginner-friendly repo to demonstrate GitHub activity. I will add more features later (multiple coins, charts, web UI).
